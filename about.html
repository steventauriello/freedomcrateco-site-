  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <p>Freedom Crate Co. was founded by <strong>Steven Tauriello</strong> — podcaster, social media influencer, craftsman, and a man of deep faith. Steven comes from a family of artists (both grandfathers were well-known painters) and has spent years building his own name through his podcast, writing, and online presence. Above all, he is a believer in God and the values of faith, family, and freedom.</p>

  <p>The spark for Freedom Crate came from a <strong>Cold War–era ammo can for 7.62×51</strong> a friend’s dad gave Steven. At first, he used it for baseball cards, but one day thought: <em>why not use it for ammo?</em> That curiosity sent him searching online for a proper <strong>military-style wooden ammo box</strong>. What he found was either beat-up surplus or presentation boxes that didn’t fit his vision. So he built his own.</p>

  <p>Steven has always loved working with his hands — blanket chests, bookshelves, desks — and has always had a thing for boxes. Designing <strong>ammo storage crates</strong> felt natural. His first one copied the Cold War can’s proportions but was tweaked to hold <strong>20 boxes of 9mm</strong>. That became the <strong>Freedom Crate Classic</strong>.</p>

  <p>The hardest part was the <strong>handles</strong>. His first version used half-inch hemp rope tied through <strong>¾″ holes</strong> in the sides — tough, but the inside knots stole capacity and broke the interior seal. He wanted the interior as <strong>airtight as possible</strong> and full edge-to-edge capacity, so no more holes through the walls. After countless hours, he developed a <strong>fail-proof, outside-mounted handle system</strong> that’s now a proprietary design — rugged, comfortable, and uncompromising.</p>

  <p>When Steven showed a Marine buddy, he asked for one to hold his medals. That’s when it hit him: these crates weren’t just ammo storage — they were <em>functional pieces of art</em>. He also wanted them to be <strong>affordable</strong>. Even as material costs rose, Steven kept pricing fair while using better wood, real hinges, and stronger hardware. He wasn’t chasing margins — he was chasing value.</p>

  <p>That old saying kept echoing: keep a thousand rounds for each caliber you own. That inspired the lineup — from the Classic to the <strong>1000-round .308 crate</strong> — and the <strong>Freedom Crate Footlocker</strong> for bug-out and hurricane prep gear.</p>

  <p><strong>Since the very first build, Steven hasn’t stopped improving the crates.</strong> He’s constantly in R&amp;D — testing corrosion resistance, waterproofing, and air-sealing. He’s experimenting with advanced <strong>elastomers</strong> and <strong>silicone-based polymers</strong> used in industries that protect heavy equipment and infrastructure. He’s studying corner brackets and structural braces for long-term rigidity. Each design iteration makes the crates stronger, sturdier, and more rugged. His goal: for these boxes to last a lifetime — even multiple lifetimes — to be passed down like heirlooms. That’s why he signs the bottom of each box and makes them repairable. If something breaks, it shouldn’t mean the crate is trash. These boxes are built to endure, be fixed, and keep serving for generations.</p>

  <p>What started as a search for a decent ammo box turned into a mission — building a handle system, crafting one for a Marine friend, and eventually creating a full lineup of <strong>purpose-built wooden crates</strong>. Steven Tauriello never set out to build a company — he set out to build boxes that made sense. Now, Freedom Crate Co. builds them for people who want the same: storage that’s strong, reliable, and built to last.</p>

      <aside class="about-card goals" id="our-mission">
        <h2>Mission &amp; Values</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Build <strong>reliable, hard-use</strong> boxes that look sharp and work harder.</li>
          <li>Honor American craftsmanship with <strong>hand-built, small-batch</strong> production.</li>
          <li>Keep things <strong>simple, serviceable,</strong> and <strong>affordable</strong> with free shipping.</li>
          <li>We’re always in R&amp;D—engineering tougher, smarter designs for every use case, whether that’s range days, long-term ammo storage, or everyday carry solutions like our med kit box with sliding trays and dividers.</li>
          <li>I build each box as if I was building it for myself.</li>

    <section class="about-card goals" id="legacy">
      <h2>The Legacy Project: Where We’re Headed (My Dream Goal)</h2>
      <p>Our long-term goal is bigger than just building crates—we want to give back. The Legacy Project will be the non-profit side of Freedom Crate Co., created to honor newly retired veterans by gifting them handcrafted crates to hold their medals, awards, and keepsakes.</p>
      <p>The project will be funded solely by a percentage of profits from Freedom Crate Co. sales and by donations. With the support of even a few generous donors, we could be building crates for newly retired veterans for years to come.</p>
      <p>Veterans will be able to request a crate by verifying their service and choosing their branch, rank, and even a personalized quote under the lid. Once we reach the point where every newly retired veteran can receive a Freedom Crate at no cost, our vision will be complete.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Give-Back:</strong> provide free handcrafted crates to newly retired veterans.</li>
        <li><strong>Personalization:</strong> branch insignia, rank, initials, or a custom quote under the lid.</li>
        <li><strong>Funding:</strong> supported by Freedom Crate Co. profits and generous donor contributions.</li>
      </ul>
