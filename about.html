  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <p>The idea started with a <strong>Cold War–era ammo can for 7.62×51</strong> a friend’s dad gave me. I was using it for baseball cards, but one day I thought: <em>why not use it for ammo?</em> That sent me online, digging through Etsy and eBay for a proper <strong>military-style wooden ammo box</strong>. What I found was either beat-up surplus or presentation-style boxes that weren’t my style. So I built my own.</p>

  <p>I’ve always loved building with my hands — blanket chests, bookshelves, desks — I’ve always had a thing for boxes. Designing <strong>ammo storage crates</strong> felt natural. My first one copied the Cold War can’s proportions but I tweaked it to hold <strong>20 boxes of 9mm</strong>. That became the <strong>Freedom Crate Classic</strong>.</p>

  <p>The hardest part was the <strong>handles</strong>. My first version used half-inch hemp rope tied through <strong>¾″ holes</strong> in the sides — tough, but the inside knots stole capacity and broke the interior seal. I wanted the interior as <strong>airtight as possible</strong> and full edge-to-edge capacity, so no more holes through the walls. After countless hours, I built a <strong>fail-proof, outside-mounted handle system</strong> that’s now my proprietary design — rugged, comfortable, and doesn’t compromise the box.</p>

  <p>When I showed a Marine buddy, he asked for one to hold his medals. That’s when I realized other people wanted these crates too — not just ammo storage, but <em>functional pieces of art</em>. And I wanted them to be <strong>affordable</strong>. Even as material costs climbed, I kept pricing in line with cheaper boxes I saw online — while using better wood, real hinges, and stronger hardware. I’m not chasing giant margins; I’m building value.</p>

  <p>I kept thinking about that old saying: keep a thousand rounds for each caliber you own. That idea shaped the lineup — from the Classic to the <strong>1000-round .308 storage crate</strong> — and the <strong>Freedom Crate Footlocker</strong> for bug-out and hurricane-prep gear.</p>

 <p><strong>Since designing my first box, I haven’t stopped improving them.</strong> I’m constantly in R&amp;D — testing corrosion resistance, waterproofing, and air-sealing. I’m currently experimenting with advanced <strong>elastomers</strong> and <strong>silicone-based polymers</strong> — ultra-durable, specialized coatings drawn from the same industries that protect heavy equipment and infrastructure worldwide. I’m currently researching how corner brackets and structural braces can reinforce joint strength and improve long-term rigidity. Every new build pushes me to make the crates stronger, sturdier, and more rugged. My goal is for these boxes to last a lifetime — even multiple lifetimes — to be passed down like family heirlooms. That’s why I sign the bottom of each box, and why I design them to be repairable. If something breaks, it shouldn’t mean the whole crate is trash. These boxes are built to endure, be fixed, and keep serving for generations.</p>
  <p>What started as a search for a decent ammo box turned into building my own, then inventing a handle system, then building one for a Marine friend, and eventually a whole lineup of <strong>purpose-built wooden crates</strong>. I never set out to build a company; I just wanted boxes that made sense. Now I build them for people who want the same: storage that’s strong, reliable, and built to last.</p>

        <h2>Mission &amp; Values</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Build <strong>reliable, hard-use</strong> boxes that look sharp and work harder.</li>
          <li>Honor American craftsmanship with <strong>hand-built, small-batch</strong> production.</li>
          <li>Keep things <strong>simple, serviceable,</strong> and <strong>affordable</strong> with free shipping.</li>
          <li>We’re always in R&amp;D—engineering tougher, smarter designs for every use case, whether that’s range days, long-term ammo storage, or everyday carry solutions like our med kit box with sliding trays and dividers.</li>
          <li>I build each box as if I was building it for myself.</li>

    <section class="about-card goals" id="legacy">
      <h2>The Legacy Project: Where We’re Headed</h2>
      <p>Our long-term goal is bigger than just building crates—we want to give back. The Legacy Project will be the non-profit side of Freedom Crate Co., created to honor newly retired veterans by gifting them handcrafted crates to hold their medals, awards, and keepsakes.</p>
      <p>The project will be funded solely by a percentage of profits from Freedom Crate Co. sales and by donations. With the support of even a few generous donors, we could be building crates for newly retired veterans for years to come.</p>
      <p>Veterans will be able to request a crate by verifying their service and choosing their branch, rank, and even a personalized quote under the lid. Once we reach the point where every newly retired veteran can receive a Freedom Crate at no cost, our vision will be complete.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Give-Back:</strong> provide free handcrafted crates to newly retired veterans.</li>
        <li><strong>Personalization:</strong> branch insignia, rank, initials, or a custom quote under the lid.</li>
        <li><strong>Funding:</strong> supported by Freedom Crate Co. profits and generous donor contributions.</li>
      </ul>
