  <!-- OUR STORY -->
  <section class="about-card" id="our-story">
    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>The idea started with a <strong>Cold War–era ammo box for 7.62×51</strong> a friend’s dad gave me. I was using it for baseball cards, but one day I thought: <em>why not use it for ammo?</em> That sent me online, digging through Etsy and eBay for a proper <strong>military-style wooden ammo box</strong>. What I found was either beat-up surplus or presentation-style boxes that weren’t my style. So I built my own. My name is <strong>Steven Tauriello</strong>, and that was the beginning of Freedom Crate Co.</p>

    <p>I’ve always loved building with my hands — blanket chests, bookshelves, desks — I’ve always had a thing for boxes. Designing <strong>ammo storage crates</strong> felt natural. My first one copied the Cold War box's proportions but I tweaked it to hold <strong>20 boxes of 9mm</strong>. That became the <strong>Freedom Crate Classic</strong>.</p>

    <p>The hardest part was the <strong>handles</strong>. My first version used half-inch hemp rope tied through <strong>¾″ holes</strong> in the sides — tough, but the inside knots stole capacity and broke the interior seal. I wanted the interior as <strong>airtight as possible</strong> and full edge-to-edge capacity, so no more holes through the walls. After countless hours, I built a <strong>fail-proof, outside-mounted handle system</strong> that’s now my proprietary design — rugged, comfortable, and doesn’t compromise the box.</p>

    <p>When I showed a Marine buddy, he asked for one to hold his medals. That’s when I realized other people wanted these crates too — not just ammo storage, but <em>functional pieces of art</em>. And I wanted them to be <strong>affordable</strong>. Even as material costs climbed, I kept pricing in line with cheaper boxes I saw online — while using better wood, real hinges, and stronger hardware. I’m not chasing giant margins; I’m building value.</p>

    <p>I kept thinking about that old saying: keep a thousand rounds for each caliber you own. That idea shaped the lineup — from the Classic to the <strong>1000-round .308 storage crate</strong> — and the <strong>Freedom Crate Footlocker</strong> for bug-out and hurricane-prep gear.</p>

    <p><strong>Since designing my first box, I haven’t stopped improving them.</strong> I’m constantly in R&amp;D — testing corrosion resistance, waterproofing, and air-sealing. I’m currently experimenting with advanced <strong>elastomers</strong> and <strong>silicone-based polymers</strong> — ultra-durable, specialized coatings drawn from the same industries that protect heavy equipment and infrastructure worldwide. Every new build pushes me to make the crates stronger, sturdier, and more rugged. My goal is for these boxes to last a lifetime — even multiple lifetimes — to be passed down like family heirlooms. That’s why I sign the bottom of each box, and why I design them to be repairable. These boxes are built to endure, be fixed, and keep serving for generations.</p>

    <p>What started as a search for a decent ammo box turned into building my own, then inventing a handle system, then building one for a Marine friend, and eventually a whole lineup of <strong>purpose-built wooden crates</strong>. I never set out to build a company; I just wanted boxes that made sense. Now I build them for people who want the same: storage that’s strong, reliable, and built to last. Freedom Crate Co. is more than a shop to me — it’s a calling, and I’m proud to put my name, <strong>Steven Tauriello</strong>, behind every box that leaves my bench.</p>

  <!-- FINAL SALUTE PROJECT -->
  <section class="about-card" id="final-salute-project">
    <h2>The Final Salute Project</h2>
    <p><strong>The Final Salute Project</strong> is our give-back mission: to honor newly retiring veterans with a <strong>free, handcrafted keepsake crate</strong> to store medals, awards, and service mementos. Every crate is built to the same standard as our retail boxes — rugged, repairable, and made to last.</p>

    <p>Each gift crate is <strong>personalized</strong> with the veteran’s name, rank, branch insignia, and (optionally) a short message under the lid. The goal is simple: when a service member hangs up the uniform, they should have a meaningful place to preserve their story — crafted with gratitude by fellow Americans.</p>

    <p><strong>How it’s funded:</strong> We fuel the project through a mix of <em>community donations</em> and a defined portion of <em>Freedom Crate Co.</em> profits. As support grows, we aim to increase monthly gifts and reach more retirees across the country.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Gift personalized keepsake crates to retiring veterans.</li>
      <li><strong>Personalization:</strong> Branch insignia, name, rank, and optional inscription.</li>
      <li><strong>Funding:</strong> Donor support + a share of Freedom Crate Co. proceeds.</li>
      <li><strong>Vision:</strong> Scale from monthly gifts to “<em>every retiree we can reach</em>.”</li>
