  <p>“After purchasing an ammo box for myself, I contacted Steven at FREEDOMCRATECO about a custom box for my Legion Posts POW/MIA memorabilia.
And look at this! It is very very cool!
FREEDOMCRATECO did this Awsome build just for our post and he did is fast!
If you want a quality product and made by a high quality guy, deal with Steven at FREEDOMCRATECO!
No longer will this Legion Posts be storing its treasured POW/MIA items in an old worn out cardboard box!
Thank you Steven and FREEDOMCRATECO!!!”</p>
